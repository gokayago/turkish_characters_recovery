# turkish_characters_recovery
Can we guess the proper spelling of a turkish word from its form which is constructed without any language specific chars? 

Examples:

 - nasilsiniz ---> nasılsınız
 - uzuluyorum ---> üzülüyorum
 - kiyma ---> kıyma
 
 Sometimes there may be more than one interpretations:
 
 - isim ---> işim
 - isim ---> isim
 
 True one can be guessed from the context of the text. So, this requires processing of whole texts and train classifiers.
